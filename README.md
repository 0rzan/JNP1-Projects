# JNP1 (Languages and tools for programming) at University of Warsaw, 2021/22

## top7
The primary objective of the task was to create a ranked list of popular music hits and handle the voting process.

Topics: STL, regular expressions.

## hash
The task involved writing a custom implementation of a hash table that utilizes a provided hash function.

Topics: Advanced STL, integrating C++ code with C code, managing global object initialization to prevent "static initialization order fiasco."

## moneybag
The task focused on creating a representation for three types of currencies. The main goals were to understand object-oriented programming (OOP), handle exceptions, and define custom operators for the created classes.

Topics: Object-oriented programming in C++, classes, constructors, operator overloading, exceptions, initialization lists, keywords: const, constexpr, etc.

## organism
The main objective was to implement interactions between organisms, which were templates. The specific interactions varied depending on the types of organisms involved.

Topics: Templates, classes, constexpr functions, templates with a variable number of arguments, fold expressions.

## kvfifo
The task involved implementing a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) queue where each element had a key-value pair. Additionally, various operations were required, such as moving all elements with the same key to the start or end, finding the maximum/minimum value of a specific key, and more.

Topics: Copy-on-write, move semantics, smart pointers, exceptions, STL, templates.

## worldcup
The task focused on simulating a board game, specifically a football world cup. The main goal was to use smart pointers to efficiently manage the players and fields on the game board.

Topics: Object-oriented programming in C++, designing well-structured classes, inheritance, exceptions, smart pointers.
